# Marketplace advertising position monitoring system

## Business Background

Marketplace sellers heavily rely on internal marketplace advertising as their primary growth channel.
In most marketplaces, advertising works as an auction: sellers increase bids to secure top positions in search results for high-frequency and revenue-critical queries.

In theory, higher bids and active campaigns should guarantee stable visibility.
In practice, sellers often face unpredictable and opaque ranking behavior:

Ads remain marked as active in the advertising dashboard

Impressions are still reported

But actual product visibility in search results suddenly drops or disappears

These drops may last from minutes to hours or even an entire day, directly impacting revenue while advertising costs continue to accrue.
